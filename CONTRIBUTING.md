# Contributing to Jazyk

Thank you for your interest in Jazyk!

## Current Status

Jazyk is **extremely early** in development and is primarily a **learning project**. I am building this to understand more in depth regarding compiler design, LLVM, and type systems. Also because I am very bored.

## Not Accepting Code Contributions Yet

With the nature of this project being of an educational type, external contributions are politely or if prompted violently rejected until a stable and statisfactory version is created. After which, contributions are open and welcomed!

## What You CAN Do

### Ideas & Suggestions
While code contributions are currently closed, **ideas and discussions are welcome!**

**Join the conversation:**
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/TamuSatyam/Jazyk/discussions) - Ask questions, propose ideas, discuss the project

### Bug Reports (when code exists)
Find a bug in the compiler? Documentation error? Let me know (I will probably spend more time on that than the actual project)!

### Documentation Feedback
Once documentation is live, feedback on clarity and completeness is incredibly valuable and also free labour.

### Stars & Follows
If you find this project interesting, give it a star and watch the repo to follow development, though you will be waiting for months for a single commit!

## Future Contributions

Once the project reaches v1.0.0, I'll update this with:
- Coding standards
- How to set up development environment
- Areas that need help
- Pull request proces

Your feedback helps shape Jazyk's development, even if you can't contribute code yet.

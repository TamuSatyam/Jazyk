# Contributing to Jazyk

Thank you for your interest in Jazyk!

## Current Status

Jazyk is **extremely early** in development and is primarily a **learning project**. I am building this to understand more in depth regarding compiler design, LLVM, and type systems. Also because I am very bored.

## Not Accepting Code Contributions Yet

With the nature of this project being of an educational type, external contributions are politely or if prompted violently rejected until a stable and statisfactory version is created. After which, contributions are open and welcomed!

## What You CAN Do

### Ideas & Suggestions
If you have an idea that aligns with the philosophy of the project, open an issue! Anything including, structuring, syntax, architecture, everything is taken into serious consideration.

### Bug Reports (when code exists)
Find a bug in the compiler? Documentation error? Let me know (I will probably spend more time on that than the actual project)!

### Documentation Feedback
Once documentation is live, feedback on clarity and completeness is incredibly valuable and also free labour.

### Stars & Follows
If you find this project interesting, give it a star and watch the repo to follow development, though you will be waiting for months for a single commit!

## Future Contributions

Once the project reaches v1.0.0, I'll update this with:
- Coding standards
- How to set up development environment
- Areas that need help
- Pull request process

## Questions?

Open an issue with the `question` label and I'll do my best to respond!
